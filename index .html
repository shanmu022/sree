               <p>History of seafoods:</p>
               <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
                The harvesting and consuming of seafoods are ancient practices that may date back to at least the Upper Paleolithic period which dates to between 50,000 and 10,000 years ago.[1] Isotopic analysis of the skeletal remains of Tianyuan man, a 40,000-year-old modern human from eastern Asia, has shown that he regularly consumed freshwater fish.[2][3] Archaeology features such as shell middens,[4] discarded fish bones and cave paintings show that sea foods were important for survival and consumed in significant quantities. During this period, most people lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and were, of necessity, constantly on the move. However, where there are early examples of permanent settlements (though not necessarily permanently occupied) such as those at Lepenski Vir, they are almost always associated with fishing as a major source of food.

                The ancient river Nile was full of fish; fresh and dried fish were a staple food for much of the population.[5] The Egyptians had implements and methods for fishing and these are illustrated in tomb scenes, drawings, and papyrus documents. Some representations hint at fishing being pursued as a pastime.
                Fish is one of the most important ingredients of Goa and kerla cuisine. Every coastal state of India, include fishes in almost every cuisine. West Bengal fish curry is very popular and its taste with rice is delicious.
